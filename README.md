PROJECT 4:
Project 4, a collection of small Python programs I created while practicing the basics of programming. This assignment was part of the Governor House program initiated by Panaverse.Each file includes different kinds of problems, ranging from simple math operations to list manipulation, mini-games, and user interaction. These tasks helped me understand how Python works and how to use its core features in fun and practical ways.

Here’s a quick walkthrough of what each file does:1. Basic Variable Operations and Input Handling
File: one.pyThis file contains a mix of beginner tasks. I started with adding two numbers, then moved on to a fun little interaction where the user enters their favorite animal. I also added a Fahrenheit to Celsius converter and a simple math riddle that changes a user’s age in a surprising way using variables.

2. Applied Math and Simulation Tasks
File: two.py

This file explores applied programming concepts:

Dice Rolling Simulator: Simulates rolling a six-sided die using Python's random module.

Mass-Energy Calculator: Implements Einstein's equation E = mc^2 to convert mass to energy.

Feet to Inches Converter: Converts height from feet to inches.

Pythagorean Theorem: Calculates the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle using the math.sqrt() function.

3. List Manipulation and 2D Data Operations
File: three.py

A deeper dive into lists and 2D arrays:

Summing Elements of a List: Loops through numbers and adds them.

Doubling List Values: A function doubles each number in a list and returns a new list.

Canvas and Eraser Simulation: Conceptually represents drawing and erasing on a canvas using 2D lists (matrices).

Working with List Indices: Prints the first and last items of a given list.

4. Conditional Logic and Repetition Structures
File: four.py

This file introduces logical conditions and loops:

Even Numbers Loop: Prints the first 20 even numbers using a while loop.

Voting Eligibility Checker: Checks if a person is eligible to vote in either of two imaginary countries based on age input. (The file may include more conditional-based mini problems, but only partial content is shown.)

5. Frequency Counting and Simple Dictionary-Based Applications
File: five.py

Focused on input aggregation and dictionary usage:

Frequency Counter: Asks the user to input 10 numbers and counts how many times each number appears using a dictionary.

Fruit Shop Bill Calculator: Asks users to input fruits and quantities, then calculates the total bill based on a predefined fruit price dictionary.

6. Number Guessing Game and Mathematical Series
File: six.py

A fun and interactive set of tasks:

Guess the Number Game: The computer picks a number between 1 and 100, and the user must guess it with hints for guidance.

Fibonacci Sequence: Prints Fibonacci numbers less than 10,000.

Even Numbers Printer: Uses a while loop to print the first 20 even numbers.

7. Randomization and Number Analysis
File: seven.py

Combines randomness, looping, and basic arithmetic:

Average of Two Numbers: Prompts user to input two numbers and prints the average.

Chaotic Counter: Randomly stops counting at an early number, creating an unpredictable experience.

Even Number Counter: Asks for five numbers and counts how many are even.

Double Number Function: A simple function that doubles the input value.

8. Utility Functions and User Information Gathering
File: eight.py

A utility-packed script with independent functions:

Age Validator: Checks if the user is an adult.

Greeter: Greets the user by name.

Number Range Checker: Validates if a number lies between 1 and 10.

Fruit Price Lookup: Prints the price of a fruit if available.

Personal Info Collector: Gathers and prints basic details from the user.

Subtract 7: Subtracts 7 from a given number using a function.
